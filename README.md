You can read our starter guide here: [https://getquanta.dev/learn](https://getquanta.dev/learn)

### Actions

Actions allow you to handle server-side logic. For example:

```php
class SaveUserAction extends Action {
    public function execute($quanta): string|bool {
        $username = $_POST['username'];
        $email = $_POST['email'];
        $quanta->databaseHandler->query("INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)", [$username, $email]);
        return false; // false because we dont want to redirect
    }
}
$quanta->actionHandler->add_action(new SaveUserAction("save_user"));
```

Trigger actions via HTTP requests like `http://localhost/?action=save_user`.

## Example: Building a User Management Module

Create a `UserModule` for handling user data:

```php
class UserModule extends Module
{
    private ?Quanta $quanta;

    public function load($quanta)
    {
        $this->quanta = $quanta;
        $this->initializeDatabase();
    }

    private function initializeDatabase()
    {
        $sql = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
        )";
        $this->quanta->databaseHandler->query($sql);
    }

    public function addUser($username, $email)
    {
        $this->quanta->databaseHandler->query(
            "INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)", [$username, $email]
        );
    }

    public function fetchUsers()
    {
        return $this->quanta->databaseHandler->query("SELECT * FROM users");
    }
}

$quanta->moduleHandler->add_module(new UserModule("user_module"));
```
